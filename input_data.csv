The WHO has not declared it a pandemic and experts say it is unlikely to become one. Rather, its spread in China fits seasonal patterns.

Yes. If any one of those virus variant from the set of viruses causing common cold like symptoms, progresses further and causes severe symptoms, then it would be classified as a seperate infection and given a seperate name.   

By this definition (and most probably) COVID-19 is a type of common cold virus. If it did not cause severe symptoms or high rate of infection then it would be literally classified as common cold. Heck, the ultimate fate of COVID-19 (by most estimated consensus) is that it will become a part of common cold. As much was said when I was infected with COVID-19 recently - no major symptoms other than light stuffy nose and body pain and my wife literally has no symptoms.

1493,"For starters,  HMPV ( AKA Human metapneumovirus) was originally found in 2001. The disease is contagious through interactions such as spreading through contact with surfaces, coughing, sneezing, and close contact in general.
To avoid it, clean surfaces often used by others, and for the love of god WASH YOUR HANDS!!! There is no vaccine or antiviral therapy to treat the disease itself. The disease usually lasts 7-10 days, so similarly to covid.

For the details about the virus's mortality rate or the effects, please research it through credible sites as well.

Viruses that affect the respiratory tract spread in the air, so when we are close to an infected person that we obviously do not know at first glance whether or not we are totally exposed to infection since this person is dispersing the virus a couple of meters around him while exhaling, speaking, cough and/or sneakers.

Unfortunately, kids are NOT adults; they exhaust their reserve without many signs that the collapse is immanent. You can't wait until they ""look worse."" This is what they look like when they are in crisis.

Please let them take her to the hospital in the ambulance. Honestly, although triage shouldn't work this way, it may make it even an inch more likely to get the last bed there. The last night I was on call, I spent the next day pulling together the direct line numbers for ""transfer centers"" (or the equivalent) for children's hospitals in the surrounding seven states.

I'd had to call four children's hospitals before I could find one for transfer. Well, one of them would have taken her, but there was a 24 hour wait expected -- and we don't have kid-sized ventilators here. The last time I saw one like this, we did intubate and just tried our best while awaiting transport.

Children's hospitals are in crisis. This is our version of the 2019 surge. RSV and flu are hitting hard, and COVID is still there, but it's the secondary pneumonias that are doing them in. Check out the nursing subreddit. Nurses without experience in pediatrics are being pulled in, including to NICUs and PICUs.

The hospital will work with you. There is some specific language to use when asking for aid if you are in that hole between Medicaid and being able to pay. We will help you. Please get her safe.

If she qualifies, this will be retroactive to the care she is about to receive, since she qualified all along.

As for whether you need to go to the hospital, that's harder to know without seeing the child. Statistically most transfers of such sort are to prevent you from suiting the doctor afterward when shit goes wrong. And yes, people sue their doctors when we don't take every possible last resort to prevent something even remotely from happening.

Hey sweetie I negotiate hospital bills for a living. I want to let you know that what you‚Äôre feeling is normal, but only because people don‚Äôt understand how not serious this is. So take a few deep breaths and let me explain‚Ä¶

Insurance carriers hire people like me to negotiate bills on their behalf. We frequently gets these bills reduced by 40, 50, 60%. This has caused providers to pad their bills, knowing they will only receive a small portion. That, plus all the uninsured folks who never pay, means hospitals and doctors try to charge an outrageous amount of money for very basic services.

You do not have to pay this bill. Ever. They can‚Äôt do anything to you. No one will force you. It will show up on your credit report but medical debt is separate from other debt. This is America. Literally everyone has medical debt. It won‚Äôt stop you from getting an apartment or buying a car or a house. It doesn‚Äôt make a difference.

In a few years, the hospital will sell it to a collections agency for pennies on the dollar. Then the collections people will send a few letters and call a few times, trying to settle with you. At this point, if you want to settle, offer a ridiculously low amount to resolve the bill in full. They will likely take it.

If you STILL want to pay before it gets sent to collections, which I would never do, call the hospital and ask for an itemized bill. It will be significantly smaller. Then ask for a self pay discount. It will be substantial. Then ask the make monthly payments, it can be a couple bucks a month. As  long as you‚Äôre making the payments, it won‚Äôt get sent to collections (which even if it does, who cares).

Please don‚Äôt do anything drastic. The system is fucked and it‚Äôs supposed to make you scared and nervous so that you sell your baby to pay the bills. In the end, the hospital knows they have no leverage against you so they want to make everything complicated and intimidating. Don‚Äôt let them win. You got this.",1,sympathy

4175,"Is HMPV worse than COVID?

Experts say the HMPV outbreak in China is not of major concern ‚Äî it is neither a new, mystery illness nor responsible for as many cases as COVID or other infections even this season. According to the latest CDC data, HMPV accounts for less than 2% of weekly positive tests of respiratory viruses. In comparison, the flu accounted for nearly 19% and COVID just over 7% for the same week. 

For a disease to be considered widespread locally, it needs to be above 10% of positive results for two weeks. At 1.9%, Garcia Carreno said it's not close to the numbers of flu, COVID and RSV.

Read the last statement. 

> it was not clear whether this was the same strain of HMPV causing a spike in China.

There are many variants of HMPV, it's a group of Paramyxoviridae family of viruses, these viruses peak during the winter season, it's been there everywhere in the world since thousands of years. 

We can't say anything unless it is confirmed that it is the same variant of HMPV from China which is rapidly spreading there, there are other variants everywhere in the world that are least harmful (and even we don't know as of now that HMPV variant in China is harmful or not). 

I guess it's least likely to be HMPV China variant because the family doesn't have any travel history and neither they were in contact with anyone who had a international travel history according to the news.

Just be cautious however, wear a mask in crowded places but dont panic, irrespective of whether it's the Chinese variant or not, a viral flu is still dangerous for kids and the old.",-1,anger

>However, health officials have emphasized that HMPV is not a new virus but a relatively under-recognized respiratory pathogen.

Another excerpt:

>Some scientists have speculated that these mutations could make the virus more neurotrophic, meaning it may have a higher likelihood of affecting the nervous system.

One more:
 >A Familiar but Often Overlooked Threat HMPV is not a new pathogen. Discovered in 2001, it has been circulating globally for over six decades, causing infections across all age groups. According to Zheng Lishu, a virologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus typically causes mild symptoms that resolve within a week. However, i t can lead to severe complications in vulnerable populations, including young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.

Infectivity is king. The flus like Corona, Common Cold, Avian Flu etc are highly infective, and that is why they are widespread. Now, a lot of us have immunity to the cold, Avian flu and now Corona. Even those that don't have immunity are not that badly affected. The reason these are dangerous though is the fact that they overwhelm the hospitals and care sytems of every country.

But that's about it! Let's first look at what is known, before generating other very alarmistic messages

For most pediatrics there was no surprise! The virus was described in 2001 by Dr Bernadette van den Hogen in chilled children in the Netherlands, although it has long existed. It is estimated that he has detached from a family of similar viruses that infect the birds. About 400 years ago.

I didn't know how to detect it so far but it has been there for a long time.

I have a dedicated HMPV slide, in the course of acute bronchiolitis that I have for students, over 15 years.

In 2012 I published, together with the colleagues from Grigore Alexandrescu Hospital and by the team of experts of the National Reference Center in the Cantacuzino Institute (led by DR CRISTINA »öECU) the results of a research that wanted to evaluate what viruses produce respiratory diseases (such as children).

Most commonly identified, at that time, were VSR (syncytial respiratory virus), HMPV and adenovirus. Link in comments

So nothing new under the sunü§ó

Where did the emotion come from? Because we are talking about an ordinary virus, from the Paramyxoviridae family, relative to the measles virus, for example.

We probably got scared because we now know that this ""enemy"" is, because we can test PCR-Multiplex, in real time, an extremely large number of people. Is the legacy of the pandemic ...

These PCR-Multiplex tests can quickly identify over 20 viruses and bacteria from a patient's nasal secretions.

So now we have all learned that there was HMPV, although he was on the podium, along with VSR and rhinoviruses as a cause of respiratory diseases. It is so common that 90% of children who go to kindergarten will have a HMPV infection up to 5 years. And because the immunity for this virus ""does not hold"", the disease can be repeated at any time.

As with the flu, 4 types of HMPV were described, depending on the surface proteins F (fusion) and G (attachment) that are noted with A1, A2, B1 and B2.

It is a simple cold for healthy adults or older children. Maybe a little noisier in 2025 than in other years, but so much.

The solution ?? We have patience, we take antitermal and we hydrate well. If it is still bad after 2-3 days we go to the doctor.

And we do not give others the disease !!! That is, we respect the label of the cough, we areolate ourselves for a few days and wash our hands well.

Much health!

Sars-Cov-1 and 2 are part of the genus betacoronavirus (next to walk-cov) but are unique in the subgenum of the Serbovirus. That is, until 2020, Sars-Cov-1 was the only Serbovir. Both SARS-COV have a common ancestor, with a mutual genetic similarity of ~ 80%. Basically this did it ""Novel Human Coronavirus"", the genetic difference from the known ones and the fact that it has not been detected in people until then.

HMPV is part of the genus metapneumovirus, but it is no further segmented in subgenics, but in genetic lines (A/B). All cases of genotypate HMPV so far have not indicated the existence of a new genetic line, so it is not ""novel"".

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country .

> Pandemics are rare

With the advent of mass industrial animal agriculture as well as the rise of wet markets in Asia, the risk of major pandemics rises. A lot. This is something which has been understood since the 1970s, that the potential for viruses to mutate with a much wider variety of animals increases due to modern agricultural methods. 

SARS, in 2002-2003, was contained before it spread too much. We were *extraordinarily* lucky to contain it, and it took a combined effort of dozens of countries mobilizing lockdowns and restrictions to take it down. If it had spread to pandemic levels, and it was a *high chance* it would have if we didn't catch it early, it had a death rate of 8-12%. Aka hundreds of millions dead. SARS uniquely spread due to wet markets. It is a pandemic which never would have happened without those modern factors mentioned above. Same with Covid. 

>  every one is an existential crisis according to the media fear machine.

RSV and Norovirus were never viewed as 'pandemics'. Norovirus can come in waves and be awful to go through (my family just had it... awful), but nobody views it as a crisis. Its still news worthy when cases spike in your city, but you are being dishonest trying to say its viewed as an existential crisis. 

The real issue is Bird Flu. That is a genuinely *massive* concern and should not be downplayed. There is not an epidemiologist in the world right now which is not extremely concerned about bird flu mutating for human transmissibility. It has spread to animal populations worldwide at a rate we have never seen in the past year, and is rapidly approaching the ability to cause human to human transmission. Bird flu has a mortality rate of 40%. This is not something to scoff at.  

Even assuming bird flu doesn't materialize into anything? As I said before, because of modern agricultural, we are still going to be dealing with the threat of pandemics much, much more commonly than in the pre-modern era.",0,sympathy

* Campaigning continues for the German elections in February and the prospect of non-AFD turnout collapsing is very scary, especially since the SPD, CDU and GRUNE are saying that the Dunkelflaute was a one-off and that everything is under control. Maybe it won't happen. Musk has been aggressively pro-AFD online and is probably doing illegal stuff in support of them already.

5988,"It‚Äôs early Monday morning, January 13, 2025, and Los Angeles feels quiet. 

The skies are clear, schools will reopen, and the general vibe is that the worst is behind us. Fires have burned nearly 40,000 acres, 24 people have died, and containment on the two largest blazes‚Äîthe Palisades and Eaton Fires‚Äîsits at 13% and 27%, respectively...those are unsettlingly low numbers, and with Santa Ana winds building tonight and peaking Tuesday, the risks ahead feel undeniable.

I've been discussing this with a few friends I have in LA, they've said we don't have to worry as Sunday was definitely a better day. Although, here‚Äôs what the conditions suggest could happen over the next 48 hours:

1. Winds will escalate the fires. Winds don‚Äôt arrive all at once‚Äîthey build. Starting tonight, gusts will climb to 30‚Äì60 mph, drying out vegetation and carrying embers 1‚Äì2 miles ahead of the fireline. By Tuesday morning, spot fires could ignite in urban neighborhoods like Brentwood, Santa Monica, and Venice. Fragile containment lines will likely fail, and the fires will spread into areas that feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù right now.
2. Air quality will plummet. Smoke and ash will blanket much of LA by Monday afternoon, with air quality reaching hazardous levels (AQI 300‚Äì400). Outdoor activity will become dangerous even far from the flames, and ash will cover streets and cars across the city.
3. Evacuations and gridlock will follow. Expanded evacuation orders in urban zones will overwhelm the 405, 10 Freeway, and Sunset Blvd. Schools reopening Monday morning may close abruptly as conditions worsen, adding to the traffic chaos.
4. Rolling blackouts and resource strain. Utilities will likely shut off power in high-risk zones to prevent further ignitions, leaving thousands without electricity or reliable communication. Fire crews will shift from containment to structure defense, stretching resources thin.
5. By Tuesday, LA could feel apocalyptic. Fires doubling in size. Ash falling everywhere. Smoke making the city feel unlivable.

This isn‚Äôt a guarantee, but the conditions are all there for this to happen. Fires don‚Äôt need to be visible or close to your block to cause chaos. Embers can travel miles ahead of the fireline, sparking new blazes in areas that seem calm today.

LA is walking into a pivotal 48 hours. By the time people realize the scale of what‚Äôs happening, it may already feel like a different city.

This account from a Long COVID sufferer explains what the experience of Long COVID can be like, and summarizes much of the scientific understanding of the illness. Another study published last week links Long COVID to ‚Äúneuro-degenerative processes, including Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.‚Äù

    The United States recorded its first human death from bird flu last week in a Louisiana patient. Officials believe the deceased contracted the virus from his/her backyard brood of chickens, which got sick from an interaction with wild birds. One human infection in San Francisco recorded last week seems to have had no known source of infection. Recent human infections are worrying some who believe it will become our next devastating global pandemic.

Trump coming will be good for india. as rupee against dollar falls, indian stocks will be more attractive per dollar as they get more worth for each dollar. so they will rush into the indian markets more. the fall is to recover dollars right now, so that when rupee goes down, as it will, they are pump in the money in dollars more. So markets will rally in a few months once rupee cross 90-95 mark.

Indian budget is something that only indians panic over. FII dont bother much as they can take their money elsewhere anytime. The budget will frankly be worse, cause the push is to make the markets more reliant on the country's money and not FII. For that you need ways to reduce FII dependency on the stock market prices. so in the short run markets will fall but FII will lose more if they pull back.

HMPV is nothing like COVID - but markets will immediately bounce back if they fall - no one took COVID seriously in the beginning, and then we all saw what happened. No surprises there.

The real thing to worry about - the housing bubble in US. 2007-08 crash soon to repeat - debt is at all time high. US employment data has been manipulated left and right. Student loans and housing loans ballooning up but real data is not being shown - its waiting for Trump to come. Jan-end is when the BLS will release employment data for the Dec-24 quarter end. Markets likely to crash in Feb-Apr period. about 40%.

HMPV was first isolated in 2001, and scientists have discovered that the virus and infection has been around for at least 50 years before that. In fact, HMPV is the 2nd leading cause of respiratory diseases amongst children in the US. Although no vaccine is available yet, Moderna did Phase 1 trials of a candidate vaccine back in 2019, before being pushed back due to the CoViD outbreak.

HMPV also is the virus which has been in our world through 60 years and isn't really concerning virus. Instead it's a mild one and can be dealt with easily.
Plus the cases which are recorded in India and the ones infected don't have any travel history either, again proving the point that the virus would just show up randomly.

6585,"hey mate let\`s exclude this Indian Media Fiasco I have been studying about this virus for a couple of days because of the hype and here is my conclusion or summary to the topic

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

COVID is an abbreviation for **CO**rona**VI**rus **D**isease. It is not a genus and has nothing to do with scientific nomenclature. It was a convenient name to use so people didn't keep panicking whenever the acronym SARS came up. COVID-19 was caused by *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* (so the genus is *Betacoronavirus*), which is the same species which caused SARS in 2001.

Forcing us to get all scientific here rams the point home. *Human metapneumovirus* is a species isolated in 2001. *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* is a species which caused an epidemic in 2001. Yes, they both already have existed in humans for some time, that doesn't mean new variants don't appear (as the new variant which caused COVID-19 suddenly appeared). Nobody is saying it has, or will, but aren't we being a bit obtuse to pretend there's nothing familiar about a species of virus from 2001 suddenly spreading out of control in China after we JUST got over a pandemic caused by another species of virus from 2001 spreading out of control in China?

Layman here, but still...

As far as I understand, it's natural killer cells that eat viruses and neutrophils that go after bacteria. Killer T cells can attack both, but they need antigen tags to work and so take a bit longer. I know that the lymphocytes increased by viral infection are different enough from those increased in bacterial infection that specifically viral infections can provoke both onset and attacks of autoimmune disease. Or at least there's a not insignificant correlation that does not exist for bacterial illness.

The idea that the immune cells are too tired after fighting one kind of infection that it can't fight another sort. Not how it works and they largely aren't the same immune cells.

But then, how would he screw it up? Definitely going to conflate natural killer cells, natural killer t-cells, and killer t-cells all to heck. Maybe even t-cells generally as a bonus. Bet ""natural killer cells"" would become the baddies, which is funny because they're definitely a hero here, but misidentifying hero and villain is Alex all over, itn't it?

The only evidence I've heard for gain of function theory is that there were some patents and the genome didn't look natural, but since you can patent anything whether it exists or not, and since the genome was not sequenced from purified virus, I don't find any of that compelling.",-1,unemotional

I dont think anything ill say will change your opinion if the virus was real or a hoax, but i knew plenty that lost someone or had serious issues from it.

Hospitals across China are overcrowded as the CCP virus outbreak continues

Recently, hospitals across China have been overcrowded again, with a large number of children and adults showing symptoms of fever and colds. The official name was ‚Äúinfluenza A‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman metapneumovirus‚Äù, but many people said that this wave of so-called ‚Äúflu‚Äù was comparable to the outbreak of the new coronavirus three years ago.

Recently, hospitals across China have been overcrowded again, and many people say that it is comparable to the COVID-19 outbreak three years ago.

Recently, hospitals across China have been overcrowded again, with a large number of children and adults showing symptoms of fever and colds . The official name was ‚Äúinfluenza A‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman metapneumovirus‚Äù, but many people said that this wave of so-called ‚Äúflu‚Äù was comparable to the outbreak of the new coronavirus three years ago. Videos of crowded children‚Äôs hospitals across China have been circulating on social media platforms in recent days, with many children showing symptoms such as fever and cough. A netizen posted a video saying that the ‚Äúflu‚Äù this winter is as powerful as the new coronavirus three years ago . All the hospital beds are occupied. Not only the pediatric department, but also the adult department is overcrowded. Many young and elderly people are infected and have fever.

There are also videos showing that in some hospitals‚Äô pediatric departments, there are still many people queuing up for medical treatment late at night. Some parents even arrive at the hospital in the early morning to queue up for a number, and the infusion room is crowded with people. The Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs official media claimed that this wave of infection was caused by the outbreak of ‚ÄúH1N1‚Äù. However, many mainland netizens said that the symptoms of H1N1 are exactly the same as those of the new coronavirus. On December 25, the video blogger ‚ÄúPlease Fei Ge‚Äù said that he and his wife went to Guangzhou to attend an event recently. After returning, they both had a fever, repeated high fevers, body aches, and headaches, just like the feeling of being positive that year. Later, it was learned that all 8 or 9 people who attended the event were infected with ‚ÄúA-type influenza‚Äù. In order to avoid infecting their children, he and his wife have been isolated for three days, and they still have a low-grade fever. He reminded everyone: ‚ÄúThis feeling is exactly the same as when I got yang back then. It‚Äôs very uncomfortable. If you still remember that feeling, wear a mask when you go out in crowded places.‚Äù Many netizens on Chinese social platforms have reported that there have been collective infections among people around them. Netizen ‚ÄúËâ≤ÁîòÈÖ∏Êú¨Ëâ≤‚Äù said on Weibo on December 27: ‚ÄúA professor of infectious diseases at a hospital in a certain country gave a lecture and said that the number of patients in the fever clinic soared from 30 per day to 120 per day within a week. Of course, the good news is that the vast majority of patients who come here are ‚Äòinfluenza A‚Äô. The bad news is that the symptoms of patients are often quite severe. The good news is that patients in the fever clinic generally do not need to be hospitalized. The bad news is that the positive rate of detection in hospitalized critically ill patients is also very high.‚Äù ‚ÄúFang Naoke Deng Boyun‚Äù said: ‚ÄúAll employees of the community bank have been infected with ‚ÄòH1N1‚Äô. What happened to the promise that financial industry workers would be the least affected after the opening up? My mother called the branch secretary of her former unit today to inquire about her retirement benefits. The branch secretary is lying at home with a fever. It‚Äôs not good to be a ‚Äòlying-down cadre‚Äô.‚Äù

This pot is not that Hu. I just want to stretch my waist again.‚Äù said: ‚ÄúAt least four offices in our unit have collectively laid down.‚Äù ‚ÄúPottery Jar‚Äù said: ‚ÄúH1N1 is rampant in my workplace.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe next door prince‚Äôs Weibo‚Äù said bluntly: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs COVID-19 positive.‚Äù Li Hongye, chief physician of women and children at Zhumadian Central Hospital, told Elephant News: ‚ÄúThe flu has entered an outbreak period. According to the hospital‚Äôs epidemiological survey, the number of patients in December increased tenfold compared to November.‚Äù On December 27, Kan Biao, director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a press conference, ‚ÄúThe recent upward trend in the positive detection rate of influenza viruses has been obvious. We have entered the seasonal epidemic period and will continue to rise for some time to come.‚Äù He also claimed that the new coronavirus infection is now at a relatively low epidemic level. The China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminds that human metapneumovirus has entered its peak period, and the symptoms are similar to those of other respiratory pathogen infections. There are currently no specific drugs or vaccines . Some netizens bluntly said that this was another outbreak of the ‚Äúnew crown‚Äù.

This virus is more dangerous than normal flu, but not as dangerous as Sars Covid 19 or other flu viruses. In cold countries such as Chinese, crowded, crowded, the disease, it is more contagious, and the ship does not have good health as Europe or the US, and the immune system of the Chinese people is very weak, so the hospital overload is natural. 

First of all, you should not panic, worry about a pandemic like Covid 19. Because this is a very popular virus, has been a long time ago and has been discovered since 2001. It has lived with humans for decades, the symptoms are still the same as the cold, the most influence is the respiratory system. 

But. If you live in Vietnam, a place with climates, bad air quality, dirty habitat. And you think you have a poor immune system. Then you should wear a mask, avoid crowded places if possible, regularly wash your hands with antiseptic products. Going to the clinic when there are symptoms (how symptoms are hard to refer to the internet). 

It could be due to the back of the covid, injecting the vaccine of the ship, so the Chinese people were so weak. But other Vaccine of England or Germany, recently being peeled off is reducing resistance, increasing the risk of other diseases.

It's normally a mild virus and often confused with its cousin RSV or other respiratory viruses. HPMV and RSV are virtually identical in symptoms, vulnerable populations and season, which it also shares with influenza and all the other usual winter respiratory viruses.

Normally it only gives you several days of cold  symptoms. But in young infants, elderly, and the immunocompromised, it can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia, which is how it becomes deadly.

There is no vaccine yet for HMPV. The only treatment is symptom alleviation and generic antivirals.

>So...if you're a senior who has had both the Flu and Pneumonia vaccines, you shouldn't be fearing for your life. You're probably going to be okay. 

I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre trying to say that the pneumococcal (‚Äúpneumonia‚Äù) vaccines will protect against HMPV pneumonia‚Äîit won‚Äôt. That vaccine protects against a specific bacterial cause of pneumonia that often occurs secondarily to viral infections but, unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt help with viral infections themselves. 

We also don‚Äôt know how effective the flu shot is this season. It‚Äôs too early in the Northern Hemisphere season to have usable data but, [per CDC estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7339a1.htm), in the Southern Hemisphere VE was around 35%. Not the greatest even by flu vaccine standards but it‚Äôs still always better to get vaccinated than to skip it.

>Kids on the other hand‚Ä¶there is no Pneumonia vaccine for them

Kids under 5 are supposed to get full series of the Hib and pneumococcal vaccines both of which protect against bacteria which are common causes of pneumonia (along with meningitis and sepsis). Again, though, neither of these will protect against pneumonia caused by HMPV",0,anger
8088,"This amazes me! Why are we not informed about this child pneumonia vaccine in FL? I know it's pretty uniform, so I'm guessing it's our lovely Ladapo, crushing vaccine info as usual. 

Here is the schedule for children under 6 yrs:

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/child-easyread.html

Hasn't vaccination become amazing!? The thing about this is that kids need to see their pediatrician often, and the kids I saw (and their parents) were entirely unaware of the vaccines their kids (under 6) had gotten. Since my Urgent Care no longer had a clinical member that was registered to update vaccine records, we stopped accepting vaccine record cards for kids getting school physicals. 

The fact that kids (hopefully) have been armed with lots of antibodies against Flu and bacterial pneumonia also cheers me - but parents need to be very wary. With kids in daycare it's going to be rough, and parents need to be responsible about spreading illnesses within their toddler's circles.   

You're right. Having a flu shot and pneumonia shot is the same as getting a Covid shot: they are not wholly preventative. Viral pneumonia is a tricky customer. 

But having these shots and *mask wearing* really *does* cut the infection rate, no matter which way you look at it. *Not* getting the Flu (or having a milder infection, teamed up with Tamivir) will spare most seniors from bacterial pneumonia, community spread pneumonia, walking pneumonia, and viral pneumonias like HMPV. 

(Just remember seniors: Going on those care-free maskless cruises will virtually *guarantee* that you come home with *something*.)

You should know that the readers of this subreddit are staunchly aware that mask wearing and proper hand hygiene are the two big tools in our arsenal against catching the viruses that plague us. 

We tend to work in tandem with the r/zerocovidcommunity to keep people aware, and help those with few options protect themselves. 

Very happy to have you here to help. We have very few Pediatricians in this sub, and as you can tell, I am distinctly behind the times. I need to do more research in future posts.

But that covers nothing about all of the factors that have gone into the steadily increasing risk from avian flu over the past 4 and 1/2 years, the future risks stemming from the fact that TWO severe cases in North America have now thrown dangerous mutations after infection, the risks caused by the never-ending bird infections, the risk from the feline infections, etc etc etc. ""Low"" risk refers only to this exact moment while ignoring absolutely all potential risk *surrounding* this moment.",-1,fear

8488,"Yes. So many things were done for the sake of ""avoiding panic"". Around that time, I read a news article about a study that basically said that people don't panic that way. The stuff that you see in the movies is almost never what really happens, unless there is a nearly total breakdown of social order. And epidemic disruption is not on that scale. 

By withholding information, public health officials and ensured that they lost credibility as the pandemic progressed.

The announcement as it stands is technically true, but only for the present. They should take the attention of the press as an opportunity to prepare the public and to ask for more resources to head off the disease. They should be saying something like:

 ""The level of danger is low for the time being, but could change into a deadly pandemic with only a few mutations to the virus. To prepare for that eventuality, more resources need to be allocated to develop a vaccine to be deployed preemptively while the disease is monitored more closely with widespread testing.""",1,relief
8489,Why exactly are we making it seem like these 2 severe cases are an anomaly? Bird flu deaths are only literally uncommon this year.,-1,fear
8490,"Agreed. You have identified one of the key problems with the communication from infectious disease scientists to the public and to policymakers. 

In the case of bird flu, the threat remains low, according to official sources. However, evolution is non-linear. It may never go human to human. But if it does, the threat immediately becomes high. 

There will be no ‚Äúmiddle threat‚Äù level. There should be a way to communicate this. However, policy flows from policy makers which flow from politicians. More and more, politicians are controlled by financial interests exclusively in the short term. If scientists were heeded more generally, this virus likely would have been contained a long time ago. But that would have angered farmers and people that consider egg prices to be the penultimate measure of societal worth. 

The public, for the most part, is not scientifically literate. There are massive risks to causing alarm for something that may not come to fruition. If we had trust in our leaders and/or scientifically literate populations in the UK and the US, a nuanced approach would benefit us all. 

This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things.",-1,anger

That common cold virus by itself put someone in their early 40's in my household in the hospital for more than a week, gasping for breath and having to be put on nebs etc. They couldn't do anything. Labs were all out of whack. And nothing pre-existing except asthma so mild it was not necessary to treat it before this. 

She was tested for everything under the sun, and nothing was positive but hMPV. I honestly feel that not enough caution is given to what were routine viral infections before, to now since Covid has hit multiple times. Up to date on all vaccines, and it wrecked her.",-1,sympathy

She was on maxed steroids a few days in a row, she was on round the clock neb treatments almost the whole time. So a ""known asthma history"" where in fact she never even needed an inhaler previous to hospitalization doesnt seem routine. 

The doctors didnt exaxtly know why things progressed as they did. Everything was clear but hMPV. And yeah, ""all out of whack"" was essentially the one descriptor that came to mind.",-1,sympathy

While not conclusive, I feel its something to be cautious of going forward for providers as evidence shows altered immune response in long covid patients as well. Even those with asymptomatic covid infections.",0,surprise

She luckily is now out, but on several meds for worsened and complicated asthma now. 

I feel that because hMPV is ""related"" to RSV in a way, its worth keeping an eye on as it progresses.",-1,fear

8625,"Tell me about it. Up until the 1980's there was a consensus in medicine that babies could not feel pain. Accordingly, pain relief for infants was minimal, often limited to sucrose solutions, even during invasive procedures. Although research in the 1980s began to show that infants have distinct physiological stress responses to pain, many clinicians refused to use it, opting instead for nitrous oxide and muscle relaxing agents that dampen pain rather than block it. Cases such as this one remind us just how much remains unknown, especially in fields involving complex systems like human biology and psychology.

The ""not new"" part is more important than it sounds. Pandemics are usually caused by novel viruses: they are virtually unknown until suddenly exploding in cases. For example, COVID became a pandemic within a span of about 4 months after detection, which happened very shortly after the first animal-human transmission.

one major issue that caused a huge shift in trust away from public officials, was their strategy to avoid a panic by misdirecting and misleading the public. famous example here in switzerland is when we were told masks weren't effective tools. (a statement that was made in the early days as there weren't enough masks and healthcare workers needed them first) - that strategy ultimately lead to a massive loss of trust in public officials, as everyone now understood that government officials weren't truthful, in order to avoid any form of panic to onset and to secure supply of critical resources. which begs the question: why should they be trusted going forward, if they don't trust the public to handle the truth.",-1,disgust

At such low numbers, hMPV does not sound like the current culprit in China, as the current mortality rate is about 1 in 3 (from what has been reported). Unless perhaps it has mutated, but we won't know that for a few more months in all likelihood.

Then we care more about animals than plants generally. Then we care more about large organisms than microorganisms and so on. The more similar a beings DNA is to us the more compassionate we are.

- Most people have immunity: most people, especially children, have been infected with HMPV before the age of 10 years, so they have immunity to this virus. This immunity makes re -infection tends to be lighter.
- Low mortality rate: Although HMPV can cause severe diseases in vulnerable groups, the level of death is generally low. Unlike the Covid-19 which has a significant mortality rate, especially at the beginning of Pandemic.

So if Asian Americans mask up as a precautionary measure (even while they are not sick), other Americans just think they‚Äôre sick.

I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs less of a cultural issue, and more of an educational issue that affects both China and the U.S.

Education should include basic life skills such as financial literacy and technology usage; sanitation and health science should be added to that list as well",1,sympathy

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

For now wait for the official report made by WHO and CDC that will decide the future of this world.",-1,fear

Indian officials have confirmed the vast nation's first cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), with seven people said to have contracted the virus as of Tuesday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Two of the HMPV infections were reported in the central Indian city of Nagpur on Tuesday, while two cases were reported in cities of Bengaluru, and one each in Ahmedabad, Chennai and Salem on Monday. The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.

Medical News: Surge in Cases Raises Concerns
China has been grappling with a marked increase in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infections and related hospitalizations since mid-December 2024.

Reports from various provinces indicate a steady rise in cases, creating apprehension about the possibility of a novel viral outbreak. However, health officials have emphasized that HMPV is not a new virus but a relatively under-recognized respiratory pathogen.

¬† Experts have pointed out that HMPV is often overshadowed by more widely known respiratory viruses like influenza and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). This Medical News report aims to provide a detailed and accessible explanation of the situation, delving into the latest developments and their implications.

¬† Spotlight on New HMPV Lineages
Researchers in China have recently identified new lineages of HMPV belonging to subtype A2. These lineages reportedly exhibit significant mutations in three key proteins, raising questions about their potential impact on disease severity and transmission.

While detailed data has not yet been made public, early findings have prompted a closer investigation. Some scientists have speculated that these mutations could make the virus more neurotrophic, meaning it may have a higher likelihood of affecting the nervous system.

¬† Also, many local media reports are mentioning about infected individuals feeling a sense of dizziness and also cognitive issues, and also cases of children and the elderly being admitted due to encephalitis are all ¬†indirectly validating that the new HMPV lineages could be more neurotrophic after all.

¬† Domestic media outlets have noted that many individuals with HMPV infections are experiencing flu-like symptoms, such as dizziness, persistent cough, and fatigue. However, experts caution that these symptoms are non-specific and overlap significantly with those of other respiratory illnesses.

¬† A Familiar but Often Overlooked Threat
HMPV is not a new pathogen. Discovered in 2001, it has been circulating globally for over six decades, causing infections across all age groups. According to Zheng Lishu, a virologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus typically causes mild symptoms that resolve within a week. However, i t can lead to severe complications in vulnerable populations, including young children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.

¬† Ruan Zhengshang, an infectious disease expert at Xinhua Hospital in Shanghai, has advised the public not to self-diagnose based on symptoms alone. ‚ÄúIt is not accurate to differentiate between influenza, HMPV, and other respiratory infections based on the severity of fever or dizziness,‚Äù he explained. Instead, he urged individuals with worsening symptoms to seek professional medical evaluation.

¬† Challenges in Diagnosis
Unlike influenza or COVID-19, HMPV does not yet have widely available rapid diagnostic tests. Laboratory testing, while accurate, is both expensive and time-consuming, posing a barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, many cases may go unrecognized or misdiagnosed as other respiratory illnesses.

¬† Managing and Preventing Infections
Tang Lanfang, a pediatric respiratory specialist from Children‚Äôs Hospital at Zhejiang University, has highlighted the need for vigilance among parents and caregivers. Severe cases of HMPV can lead to pneumonia, especially in children. Symptoms such as persistent high fever, worsening cough, lethargy, and shortness of breath should prompt immediate medical attention.

¬† Currently, there are no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines for HMPV. Management focuses on supportive care, including adequate rest, hydration, and symptom relief. Preventive measures are crucial and include wearing masks, frequent hand washing, ensuring proper ventilation, and avoiding crowded spaces - guidelines echoed by both Chinese and international health authorities.

¬† Concluding Thoughts
The ongoing rise in HMPV infections in China underscores the need for heightened awareness and continued research. The emergence of new lineages within subtype A2 raises important questions about the virus‚Äôs behavior and its potential implications for public health. While most cases remain mild, the risk to vulnerable groups highlights the importance of prevention and timely medical intervention.

Ribosomes build viral proteins. Viral proteins assemble into full virion.

LoL at household transmission. The very same metric can be used to prove that obesity is a transmitted virus. 

You are dodging the fact that we are lead to believe that passing an infected stranger, or sitting near someone on a train for a few minutes can (and will) lead to becoming infected by them. 

Despite the absolutely abundant instances of people having flu we still require them to come to a lab and have a 'virus' squirted directly into their nose (and with the 'viral load' being high enough) before we can prove transmission?

You know this brings up something I've noticed among germ theory deniers/terrain theory supporters. Not once can they name a single specific toxin/chemical/poison/negative emotion/etc that has been shown to cause the flu, Ebola, rabies, plague, tuberculosis, etc.  In fact no one even gives advice on how to *avoid* them. The only thing said is to let your body kill itself as it ""detoxifies"" itself of these unknown nebulous toxins.  Why suffer if you can easily avoid the toxin or whatever that's responsible for causing your ailments. And this doesn't even begin to scratch the surface that is the abysmal failure of terrain theory to explain why common causes don't cause rare events at a more common occurrence. As an example I've seen rabies be blamed on malnutrition/famine (after much poking and questioning done). Over a billion people across the planet are malnourished and rabies only has ~56,000 cases per year with the majority focused in India.

Personally I would question whether a known chemical/element causes symptoms similar to a particular disease. For example Polio and heavy metal poisoning (look at spinal lesions if you are actually interested). Small pox and serious malnutrition coupled with severe bedbug infestation (and subsequent bug fecal matter composition). The most recent ebola incident that I am aware of was said to be due to a tainted malaria vaccine which affected aid workers. (special mention of tainted vaccines goes to Bill Gates and his Polio vaccine in India). Other than that the ebola virus only seems to be present in African countries where I am sure they don't have the best safety standards for chemical fertilisers and the like. 

My personal belief is that both flu and colds are not viruses but are just a general bodily warning system. Each person has their own personal threshold for the amount of nasties their body can easily vanquish (based on age, fitness, diet etc). If the body becomes slightly overwhelmed (or doesn't understand why its temperature has fluctuated so much in a short space of time - see current UK weather change over the past week or two) it brings about the symptoms associated with having a cold to force you to take it easy and not increase the strain. If further nasties are added (or a greater hit of nasties in one go) the body tries to limit activity and promote rest which results in flu symptoms. If you want to test this theory I would suggest that you ingest large amounts of nasties in the form of alcohol. You will notice that the majority of hangover symptoms are the exact same as flu symptoms. Albeit with vomiting replacing nasal discharge due to the method of consumption of said nasties. 

As for your rabies bit, personally I would look up what else causes light/water aversion and foaming at the mouth, taking a look at the composition of the saliva of canines in particular as this seems to be the source of transmission. So, it would be something that is present in the dog and being released into the saliva.

Wow, that totally proves viral transmission! And it is in no way different from real world conditions which produces countless cases. 

You really think that this far removed from reality set of conditions producing some nonsense result that cant be proven without modern technology constitutes proof of viral transmission?

MRNA is one of the more profitable companies in the Biotechnology industry with a net margin of 59.69%. Its operating margin and net margin are among the strongest of any peer while its gross margin is above the industry median.

Seeking Alpha: Moderna: High Upside Potential At Current Prices- Moderna is a high reward bet on mRNA technology succeeding in either preventing or curing many difficult to treat diseases.
The 58% pullback from Moderna's all-time high of $497.49 gives aggressive growth investors a chance to buy into a company with significant potential upside.

9907,"Absolutely not a dumb question‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not a doctor (just a chemistry nerd deeply intrigued by virology) so I don‚Äôt have a definite answer for you.. but a quick google search gave me this:

‚ÄúImmunity from H1N1 influenza typically lasts for a couple of years, with antibody levels gradually declining over time, meaning you may need to get vaccinated again periodically to maintain protection; however, the exact duration can vary depending on individual immune response and the specific strain of H1N1 involved. 

**Key points about H1N1 immunity:**

**Short-term protection:**
After a natural infection or vaccination, initial immunity against H1N1 is strong but gradually wanes within a few years. 

**Flu strain variations:**
Because influenza viruses can mutate, immunity against one H1N1 strain might not fully protect against newer variants.‚Äù

She was a little surprised and tested him, instant line on the test. Then his dad was like crap, I've been feeling really tired, takes a test, instant line as well. Neither had typical symptoms and I only knew the kid had it because I'd read something on here about a parents kids first symptom of that strain being an earache. The dad was just tired, that was his only symptom and he had been working long hours that week so it wasn't caught as covid. 

I hung out with the kid, let him play on my switch until they left for home. I was immune since I'd just had it. 

Now, the best part, no one else got it. There were 20+ people there, everyone mingling, kids playing etc and no one else got it. My boyfriends parents and his aunt and uncle were there and they were fine.",0,surprise
10161,"Thank you so much for your many points of comfort-- I still don't entirely understand who becomes + and who doesn't in an environment of exposure -- my uncle did test positive that night but thankfully the other 6 ppl there continue to be symptom-free, and a friend who I happened to be on my flight that day and sat next to me is also neg. 

Fingers crossed, so far the rest of my immediate household remains symptom free or negative, but I guess I'll be nervous for a few more days b/c of exposing them a bit my first day of symptoms. And my test line is still dark with a stuffy nose and dry throat :(. Here's to getting through this isolation.",-1,sympathy

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country .

one major issue that caused a huge shift in trust away from public officials, was their strategy to avoid a panic by misdirecting and misleading the public. famous example here in switzerland is when we were told masks weren't effective tools. (a statement that was made in the early days as there weren't enough masks and healthcare workers needed them first) - that strategy ultimately lead to a massive loss of trust in public officials, as everyone now understood that government officials weren't truthful, in order to avoid any form of panic to onset and to secure supply of critical resources. which begs the question: why should they be trusted going forward, if they don't trust the public to handle the truth.",-1,disgust

The Hmpv virus everybody is talking and discussing about is the 50 year old version and we do not have exact data from the epicentres China and malaysia Hence all the info that i will provide will be of the old european strain.

Keeping that in mind

1. Hmpv has a lower Ro(1.4-2) value than covid 19 (1.5-3) and the delta variant had (3-5) Ro means the number people a virus can be transmitted from one affected person.

2.The syptoms of Hmpv coincides with the common cold so repoting and identifying the virus will be difficult for an individual hence less reportings and less testing in the hospital.

3. The incubation period of Hmpv is less than covid19 and the gestation period is also less meaning you will down only for a week not for 14 to 21 days

4. Hmpv has an extra complication which is pneumonia including Bronchitis and both old age and infants are at risk .

It can get uglier if not treated ..

The suspicison arises when the world is experincing an all time high in Hmpv cases note not once in 50 years it has affected so many people and if it has mutated it can be dangerous NOTE when delta version arrived we already had a vaccine but the world was severly hit and if it so mild in the world why the government and WHO is pating so much attention it just can\`t happen with Indian media and the first death reported in India due to covid was mad in 12th MARCH 2024 when a novel took this much time in 1.2 billion people country . Please do not be overconfident this mistake has been done review the past .

10494,"Here's a preview of the story: 

Indian officials have confirmed the vast nation's first cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), with seven people said to have contracted the virus as of Tuesday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Two of the HMPV infections were reported in the central Indian city of Nagpur on Tuesday, while two cases were reported in cities of Bengaluru, and one each in Ahmedabad, Chennai and Salem on Monday. The cases include a three-month-old girl who tested positive for HMPV on Monday. Another case involved an eight-month-old boy who tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

HMPV can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are the most at risk for serious illness from the virus. According to the CDC, symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath.

COVID is an abbreviation for **CO**rona**VI**rus **D**isease. It is not a genus and has nothing to do with scientific nomenclature. It was a convenient name to use so people didn't keep panicking whenever the acronym SARS came up. COVID-19 was caused by *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* (so the genus is *Betacoronavirus*), which is the same species which caused SARS in 2001.

Forcing us to get all scientific here rams the point home. *Human metapneumovirus* is a species isolated in 2001. *Betacoronavirus pandemicum* is a species which caused an epidemic in 2001. Yes, they both already have existed in humans for some time, that doesn't mean new variants don't appear (as the new variant which caused COVID-19 suddenly appeared). Nobody is saying it has, or will, but aren't we being a bit obtuse to pretend there's nothing familiar about a species of virus from 2001 suddenly spreading out of control in China after we JUST got over a pandemic caused by another species of virus from 2001 spreading out of control in China?

This is what they look like when they are in crisis.

Please let them take her to the hospital in the ambulance. Honestly, although triage shouldn't work this way, it may make it even an inch more likely to get the last bed there. The last night I was on call, I spent the next day pulling together the direct line numbers for ""transfer centers"" (or the equivalent) for children's hospitals in the surrounding seven states.

I'd had to call four children's hospitals before I could find one for transfer.

Children's hospitals are in crisis. This is our version of the 2019 surge. RSV and flu are hitting hard, and COVID is still there, but it's the secondary pneumonias that are doing them in.

As for whether you need to go to the hospital, that's harder to know without seeing the child. Statistically most transfers of such sort are to prevent you from suiting the doctor afterward when shit goes wrong. And yes, people sue their doctors when we don't take every possible last resort to prevent something even remotely from happening.

Hey sweetie I negotiate hospital bills for a living. I want to let you know that what you‚Äôre feeling is normal, but only because people don‚Äôt understand how not serious this is. So take a few deep breaths and let me explain‚Ä¶

Insurance carriers hire people like me to negotiate bills on their behalf. We frequently gets these bills reduced by 40, 50, 60%. This has caused providers to pad their bills, knowing they will only receive a small portion. That, plus all the uninsured folks who never pay, means hospitals and doctors try to charge an outrageous amount of money for very basic services.

You do not have to pay this bill. Ever. They can‚Äôt do anything to you. No one will force you. It will show up on your credit report but medical debt is separate from other debt. This is America. Literally everyone has medical debt. It won‚Äôt stop you from getting an apartment or buying a car or a house. It doesn‚Äôt make a difference.

In a few years, the hospital will sell it to a collections agency for pennies on the dollar. Then the collections people will send a few letters and call a few times, trying to settle with you. At this point, if you want to settle, offer a ridiculously low amount to resolve the bill in full. They will likely take it.

If you STILL want to pay before it gets sent to collections, which I would never do, call the hospital and ask for an itemized bill. It will be significantly smaller. Then ask for a self pay discount. It will be substantial. Then ask the make monthly payments, it can be a couple bucks a month. As  long as you‚Äôre making the payments, it won‚Äôt get sent to collections (which even if it does, who cares).

Please don‚Äôt do anything drastic. The system is fucked and it‚Äôs supposed to make you scared and nervous so that you sell your baby to pay the bills. In the end, the hospital knows they have no leverage against you so they want to make everything complicated and intimidating. Don‚Äôt let them win. You got this.",1,sympathy

Even though, yes, what you're saying is totally reasonable, laypeople on the internet often don't have the ability to understand the nuance that you're trying to provide. This person is at risk of making a very bad decision.

If you got this call from a non-medical family friend: My daughter is hypoxic, has a fast resp rate, has a known pneumonia, should I bring them into the ED for assessment... what would your response be? Would you do some BS equivocating about the reliability of the sat probe or would you just tell them to bring them in? Add to that the UC physician wants to transfer them to your hospital... would you decline the transfer? Fuck no you wouldn't, so why introduce doubt on the necessity of transfer in this case.

The correct answer of the binary yes or no: Given the information in the post, should this child be transferred to the ED is obviously yes.",-1,anger

I‚Äôd definitely ask - if not insist on getting a nebulizer machine for at home if this is chronic (which it sounds like it is). You can buy the machines outright, but still need the prescription for the medication to put in it.

My Dr finally caved and gave me steroids and antibiotics after a week, which helped speed up the recovery.   
\*\*THERE IS NO MEDICATION FOR HMPV.\*\*  
All the doctors can do is just give you medication to relieve the coughing and phlegm, but it doesn't kill the virus. Its a rough and long ride to recovery if you get infected.  
  
With COVID, all i had was nausea and fever, and just couldn't get out of bed for a few days because i was so tired. All i had to do was take panadol and just sleep to get better.

I wouldn't wish HMPV on anyone. News/media/governments aren't talking about this because they can't risk another risk worldwide panic and everything shutting down and messing up the economy anymore.Just practice good personal hygiene, i would just play it safe and mask up if you go anywhere indoors or where it's crowded. and best to isolate yourself when you start feeling symptoms. it starts out feeling like a common flu but its very contagious and it takes a long time to get well.",-1,sad
11055,"It's not certain that this will pose a threat or start a lockdown, but it's likely that if you follow my logic

It will become more common, and it's already become more common, it's gonna be very very likely mutate and gain symptoms that risk survival or health and that will be seen through a dire lens and since lockdown:

- 1. Stops the spread
- 2. Was what they already did last time
- 3. Worked with covid

They're VERY likely to start another one

Again, this isn't certain, but it's likely, and panicking costs us nothing but brushing it off means we're unprepared for the most likely outcome",1,fear

11057,"The virus itself is not the issue, it's a known virus, and part of the population already have some level of immunity to it. It's not as virulent as other viruses, and it's not as severe as others.  
The problem is that it spreads, and will eventually lead to more people getting admitted.   
And the system is already stretched.   
So the concern and worry is not because of HMPV, it's because the system is not prepared for any further pressures on it. There's barely any beds left on a good day.",-1,fear

11065,"It's interesting actually because I remember 2019 my family got super sick. And here in the UK we were getting told it was just flu. So some are convinced that we actually had covid in the UK before it was actually reported to have been.

Now 2024/2025. My boss got sick, ended up with pneumonia. My mam got sick around Christmas, ended up hospitalised with pneumonia. And several others have been told they had pneumonia. 

So I wonder if it's a repeat. Oh you just have flu/pneumonia. But it will actually turn out to be whatever is spreading in China.

Just some deja vu! 

Likelihood this is actually what is happening is very slim. I wouldn't panic.

There are fears that human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is spreading further across Asia after two sick babies were hospitalized and diagnosed with the virus in India.

China earlier revealed it has been grappling with a spike of patients suffering from the flu-like respiratory infection caused by the virus this winter. The surge in cases‚Äîwhich seems to have particularly affected children‚Äîhas swept across northern China, but the country has played down fears of another Covid-style pandemic, with politicians noting that such illnesses are common during the winter months.
